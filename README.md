## Welcome to My First Repo in GitHub :)

**This is README.md**

I am currently learning how to properly introduce my repo using **Markdown**, a highly common yet simple language to write *readme* files.

I also got my first repo published on a website via GitHub Page; you can visit it here:
([my-first-repo](https://dkevin77.github.io/my-first-repo/))

As of now, I am also learning how to integrate my local repository to a remote one using `Git`. So far these are the common commands I have learned:

```
git remote add origin
git push -u origin master [your github repo link]
git pull
git clone [forked link]
```

My future learning will include the following topics:
1. Nephology
2. Cloud Computing Basics

Thank you all and wish me luck in preparing my career in software engineering!
